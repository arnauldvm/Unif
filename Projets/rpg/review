Here a few suggestions
----------------------

1 git repo per project (new release lifecycle = new repo)

Do not commit your personal/local settings (.vscode) if you want to share your code

Isolate environment of each project with `virtualenv`
-> https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/#usage

Use requirements.txt to define dependencies (i.e. required non core modules)
of each project (cf `pip` command)
-> https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files
